## Introduction

This repository holds the materials and notes from the IAM Bootcamp conducted by Cybolt. It includes theoretical knowledge, practical exercises, and additional resources to help you understand and implement IAM principles in your cybersecurity career.

## Content Overview


## Importance of IAM

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a critical aspect of cybersecurity. It ensures that the right individuals have access to the right resources at the right times for the right reasons. IAM helps in:

- Protecting sensitive information
- Preventing unauthorized access
- Reducing the risk of security breaches
- Complying with regulatory requirements

## Key Concepts

### Definiciones

**Identification:** Proving your identity.
- **Authentication:** Verifying that you are who you claim to be using:
  - Something you know (e.g., password)
  - Something you have (e.g., token)
  - Something you are (e.g., biometrics)

### JIT Access (Just in Time Access)
- Limits access to specific resources for a specific time period, reducing the window for potential attacks.

### Authentication Assurance Levels (AAL)
- **AAL1:** Single or multifactor authentication.
- **AAL2:** Two-factor authentication with approved cryptographic techniques.
- **AAL3:** Hardware-based authenticator and another authentication factor.

### SSO Protocols
- **SAML 2.0:** XML-based protocol.
- **OAuth 2.0:** Authorization framework.

### Identify Governance
- Creation, enablement, and assurance of digital identities for users, applications, and data.

### Authentication Attacks
- **MFA Fatigue Attack:** Overwhelming user with push notifications.
- **Cookie Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies.

### Controlling Access
- Principles: Least privilege, need to know, separation of duties, etc.
- Techniques: DAC, MAC, RBAC, LBAC.

### Managing and Monitoring Access
- Account administration, monitoring, maintenance, and revocation.

### Privileged Access Management (PAM)
- Tools like CyberArk, HashiCorp Vault to manage privileged access.

### Password Security
- Strong hashing and key derivation functions.
- Techniques to mitigate pre-computation attacks.

### Cryptography
- Types: Symmetric, Asymmetric, Hashing.
- PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) for secure communication.

## Labs and Practical Exercises

- **Lab Workbook IAM Bootcamp 2024.pdf:** Detailed lab exercises.
- **Capstone_Cybolt.ipynb:** Capstone project notebook.
- **A Folder:** Challenge with nested directories and files to find flags.


## Conclusion

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to IAM concepts and practices learned during the Cybolt bootcamp. It provides valuable insights and hands-on experience to help you enhance your cybersecurity skills.
